>This is just a personal project that I created to play with some libraries and blockchain concepts.

#### How to run it
Clone or download the repo. Initialize npm:

```$ npm i``` 

The script requires Mongo to be running locally in your machine in the port `27017`.

Follow the official guide from Mongo in order to install it: 

- [MacOS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
- [Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)

An excecutable will be created in the future. For now, run the following command in order to start the script:

``` $ node index.js s ```
